As if all the text-to-image models released in the last year weren't exciting enough, we've moved on to fairly high quality text-to-video already:
- https://imagen.research.google/video/ (released today, 2022-10-05)
- https://phenaki.github.io/ (released today, 2022-10-05)
- https://ai.facebook.com/blog/generative-ai-text-to-video/ (last week, 2022-09-29)

### 2022-10-05 playing with copilot

Decided to give [copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) a try this evening.
Set out to see how it works, on a toy example of hyperparameter tuning.

It was doing fairly well at generating code 
(although I'm still getting the hang of "prompting it" such 
that it produces the desired output), 
and it then surprised me with a `#TODO`, 
telling me to use a library instead of coding this stuff myself ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜‚.
 
The code snippet:

```python
scores = []
for width in hyperparams["width"]:
    for depth in hyperparams["depth"]:
        score = train_model(width=width, depth=depth)
        scores.append((score, width, depth))
scores.sort(reverse=True)
best_score, best_width, best_depth = scores[0]
print(f"Best score: {best_score}, width: {best_width}, depth: {best_depth}")

# TODO: Use a library like scikit-learn to do this more easily
# https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html
# https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html
# https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html
# https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.ParameterGrid.html
```

Update: More stuff copilot has come up with:

```python
# Iâ€™m not sure if this is the best way to do this, but it works. 
# Iâ€™m using optuna to plot the results, 
# but you could use any plotting library you want.
```

Seems to be constantly questioning my approach...
Maybe it has a point ðŸ˜…?
